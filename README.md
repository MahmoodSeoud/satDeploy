We flew [DISCO-2](https://discosat.dk/v2_disco-2/), a 3U student CubeSat, and then spent weeks trying to recreate what was on it.


The payload ran a Yocto Linux image with several apps on it, each on its own release cadence, each updated the same way: rebuild locally, copy the binary over USB or SCP, and post "I updated the binary" in Slack. By launch, nobody could list every commit running on the hardware with confidence. After launch, rebuilding the same set on our flatsat took weeks of chasing memory and old tmux sessions, and we still ran into lib version mismatches we hadn't known were there.

satdeploy is what we built so it doesn't happen again. Every deploy is versioned, hash-verified, and tagged with the git commit it came from. Every file can be rolled back with one command. It works over SSH for networked targets on the bench, and over [CSP](https://github.com/spaceinventor/libcsp) (CAN bus, KISS serial, ZMQ) for air-gapped satellite links.

> DISCO-2 is a 3U student CubeSat from Aarhus University, SDU, and ITU Copenhagen, launched on SpaceX Transporter-16 (March 30, 2026) to image Arctic glaciers from a 510 km sun-synchronous orbit. Coverage: [Danish Space News](https://danishspacenews.substack.com/p/disco-2-one-of-the-most-ambitious), [The Danish Dream](https://thedanishdream.com/danish-society/science/danish-students-launch-satellite-to-track-melting-arctic/), [project site](https://projects.au.dk/ausat/disco-2).

> **Early stage, but heading to orbit.** We built satdeploy *after* DISCO-2 launched, so the current payload is flying without it. The next uplink window will push satdeploy to the DISCO-2 payload, and every deploy after that will be versioned, hash-verified, and rollback-able from the ground. Until then it runs on our flatsat, and we're looking for other satellite teams to try it before we trust it in orbit ourselves. Does this fit your workflow? What's missing?

## Try it now

Zero dependencies beyond Python and git.

```bash
pipx install satdeploy   # or: pip install satdeploy
satdeploy demo           
```

`satdeploy demo` sets up a throwaway git repo + local target directory and pre-installs `test_app` v1.0.0. Then try the real product loop:

```bash
satdeploy status              # See what's deployed
satdeploy push test_app       # Deploy v2 (new hash, new commit)
satdeploy rollback test_app   # Undo in one command, git tag carries through
satdeploy demo stop           # Tear it down when you're done
```

Real output:

```
$ satdeploy status
  demo · local · /Users/you/.satdeploy/demo/target

## Deploy to real hardware

### SSH (networked target)

Your target has network access. You don't need any C components, just the Python CLI.

```bash
satdeploy init                   # select "ssh", enter your target's IP
```

Then edit `~/.satdeploy/config.yaml`:

```yaml
name: flatsat
transport: ssh
host: 192.168.1.50
user: root
apps:
  controller:
    local: ./build/controller          # path to your local binary
    remote: /opt/bin/controller        # where it goes on target
    service: controller.service        # systemd service to restart (or null)
```

Deploy:

```bash
satdeploy push controller
satdeploy status
satdeploy rollback controller        # undo
satdeploy logs controller            # service logs
```

### CSP (air-gapped target, CAN/serial, experimental)

The CSP path has more moving parts. You need three pieces running:

| Piece | Where it runs | How to get it |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| Python CLI *or* CSH APM | Ground station | `pip install satdeploy` or [build the APM](docs/building.md#satdeploy-apm-ground-station-native) |
| `satdeploy-agent` | Target satellite | [Yocto recipe or cross-compile](docs/building.md#satdeploy-agent-target-cross-compiled) |
| [CSH](https://github.com/spaceinventor/csh) | Ground station | Bridges ZMQ ↔ CAN/serial |

Start the agent on the target:

```bash
satdeploy-agent -i CAN  -p can0           # CAN bus
satdeploy-agent -i KISS -p /dev/ttyS1     # Serial link
satdeploy-agent -i ZMQ  -p localhost      # ZMQ (local testing only)
```

On the ground station, `satdeploy init` (select "csp") gives you a config like:

```yaml
name: my-satellite
transport: csp
zmq_endpoint: tcp://localhost:9600       # CSH's ZMQ address
agent_node: 55                           # your satellite's CSP node ID
ground_node: 40                          # your ground station's CSP node ID
apps:
  controller:
    local: ./build/controller
    remote: /opt/bin/controller
```

Then `satdeploy push controller` works the same as SSH.

If you just want to see the workflow without any of this, use `satdeploy demo`.
